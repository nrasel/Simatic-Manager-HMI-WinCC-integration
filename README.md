# Integration of Simatic Manager (S7-300 PLC) and HMI (WinCC)

This project demonstrates the integration of **Siemens Simatic Manager (STEP 7, S7-300 PLC)** with **WinCC HMI** for basic arithmetic operations.  
The PLC program performs **SUM, SUB, MUL, DIV** operations, and the results are displayed on an HMI screen.
